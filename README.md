All the functionality should be implemented inside the plugin.js file. Do not modify index.html,
and collect.js
You can use whatever tech stack you would like. We want to see how you approach the
foundations of a project.
The task:
- If the script's "isRunning" attribute value equals "false" (isRunning="false") the script
should not do anything. Otherwise, it should implement the following functionality:
- Add the triangle button in the bottom-left corner of the page (see image below). The
triangle should be always visible and always located in the bottom-left corner of the
web page.
- Clicking at the triangle should toggle the modal dialog
- The modal dialog should be a simple box with two buttons: "Accept" and "Reject". It
should be shown over the website and should be responsive to resizing.
- Block scrolling and click interactions on the website while the modal is shown.
- Clicking the Reject button should close the modal and unblock the website (allow the
user the scroll and interact with the site)
- Clicking the Accept button should do the same as clicking "Reject", but also
dynamically add the collect.js script to the HTML page
